In all the years that I've been a programmer, I've found a couple of things that seem to really help with getting ahead in the game. They're not the usual sorts of things that people talk about, they have nothing to do with programming techniques or languages/frameworks/plugins to use, or even which editor you should use (I know, shocking). They're also very subtly selfish.

Learn to Investigate
====================

When something weird happens, whether with code you've written, a library you're using, or even something you're trying to help someone else debug, knowing how to look things up in the source code leads to a lot of new discoveries, mild fame, and a lot of ease in learning things.

I'm amazed how many new and experienced developers I've seen that immediately go blank when they're hit with a bug or strange output. They freeze up, start flailing about for another developer to help them figure out the problem instead of diving into a debugger or the source code ot find out what's happened.

When I get hit with a new bug, the first thing I do is take a breath. There's no reason to freak out, even if the bug shows up in production and "breaks" something. In that case, roll back to your last good deploy, push it to production, and then start debugging.
