:slug: about-us

Brack3t was sorta-kinda founded in 2008 when the two of us (**Kenneth Love** and **Chris Jones**) got tired of doing advertising for casinos and restaurants in Las Vegas.

Since then weâ€™ve been doing awesome stuff with Python, specifically the Django project. We make websites, web apps, and general scripts for lots of different clients, both individually and together.

You can find both `Kenneth`_ and `Chris`_ on Twitter.
